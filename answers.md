1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
If you didn't spend much time on the coding assignment then use this as an opportunity to explain what you
would add.

I spent a day on this assignment, hence I am moving to a new house and something of high urgency came up. If I had the enough time and the budget I would put the docker in an S3 bucket and utilizie AWS SES

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your language of choice? Please
include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL FEATURE, is having the possibility of a nullable var just when you add a '?' in front of it, it is included in the code in types.ts file and it is utilized here: "port?:string;"


3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

by tests, debugging by consol, and keeping a live listener so if something is going wrong an email would get sent to me with the error response, it is utilized at all times and that is why we have diffferent environments i.e. Dev, Test, and Prod

4. What was the latest technical book you have read or tech conference you have been to? What did you learn?

I dont read technical books hence they get pretty outdated, rather I am always vigilant in terms of updates, hence I use social medi, nowadays marketing teams of any kind of sort even in tech use the methode of posting or newsletters to keep their fans up to date, and I go to summits(last one being AWS Summit), watch keynotes.


5. What do you think about this technical assessment?
Nice assessment thank you :)
